## Introduction

The project serves as a foundational framework for representing and manipulating computational graphs through multilist data structures in the C programming language. Additionally, it includes a neural network constructor which can be used to build and train neural networks using the defined computational graph.

## Features

- **Multilist Graph Representation**: Efficiently stores and manipulates computational graphs using multilist data structures.
- **Neural Network Constructor**: Allows users to construct custom neural networks from the computational graph.
- **Memory Management**: Handles dynamic memory allocation and deallocation to manage the multilist graph and neural network structures.
- **Graph Operations**: Supports various operations including node insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Neural Network Training**: Includes functionality to train the constructed neural networks with backpropagation (optional module).
- **Pure C Implementation**: Utilizes C for high-performance computations without relying on external libraries.
